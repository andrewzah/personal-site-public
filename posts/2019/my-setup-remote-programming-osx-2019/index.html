<p>Hi! My name is Andrew, and I work remotely as a software developer. I’ve
worked while traveling across America with spotty or no internet
connection. I’ve worked in countries like South Korea and Japan. I like
traveling, and this is how I stay productive.</p>

<p>Before you scoff, I used freebsd and arch on my home pc as daily
drivers. I used a modded thinkpad t430 for a few months as
well. <a href="#tmg">[0]</a> I put in an i7-3632QM (quadcore) chip, a quieter
heatsink, 2x8gb memory, a t420 old-style keyboard, and a 9 cell battery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was sweet… before I started lugging it around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Weight-wise it was slightly heavier than my 15&#34; macbook (~4.5lbs?), and
the battery life made it unusable. I was getting 4-5 hours, max, and
occasionally it would just die earlier than expected. (Forcing me to go
reset the system time in BIOS).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was always worried about my power source. I
<a href="https://andrewzah.com/posts/2019/living-out-of-2-backpacks-6-month-retrospective/">have lived out of two backpacks</a>
and worked remotely while traveling, so I
can’t rely on always being next to an outlet. My 2015 13&#34; macbook pro’s
battery is still good to the point that I can get 6-7 hours out of it
while working with Rust/C#. It’s more like 8-9 if I’m only doing light
writing, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know someone’s going to respond with &#34;but oh, you should’ve just used
power with x, y, z configurations!&#34;. I _did_ experiment with
different settings with power and other alternative tools–nothing
seemed to help. Call me a grumpy old man but I want to work and get
things done… not fiddle about with battery tuning settings and the like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually I’ll need to replace this mac. All post-2015 macbooks have
been undesirable to me so I’ll probably go with a dell xps 13&#34;, or maybe
a System76 Galago. I just want a durable machine with an excellent
battery that’ll work years later and won’t have me configuring things
constantly. Is that too much to ask?</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At home I do have an x201 and x220 thinkpad however. They’re great for
testing different operating systems, etc. I just don’t like traveling
with them. The x201 is quite small so hopefully it’ll become my main
writing machine.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing I always do is install xcode-tools, iTerm2, brew, and
zsh. Then I clone the osx branch of my
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree">dotfiles repo</a> and symlink
the files where they need to be. I should automate this part with a
script, but making that script would take me far more more time than
just doing it manually. Not worth it, for now at least.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use <code>brew leaves</code> to see installed items and <code>brew cask list</code>
for cask items. I
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree/osx/brew-leaves">stored</a>

<h3 id="_poor_mans_window_tiling"><a class="anchor" href="#_poor_mans_window_tiling"></a>2.1. poor man’s window tiling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After using i3 I can’t go back to non-tiling window managers. I long for
the day that i3 works natively on osx. Sigh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve somewhat replicated it with
<a href="https://koekeishiya.github.io/chunkwm/">chunkwm</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd">skhd</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner">karabiner</a>. Chunkwm is a tiling
window manager, but it doesn’t handle keyboard input. That’s where skhd
comes in. I copy/pasted to my
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree/osx/.khdrc">khdrc</a> but to be
honest I don’t use most of these hotkeys still.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, I use karabiner to make my right command key into a hyper key– it
presses shift, command, control, and option.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cons"><a class="anchor" href="#_cons"></a>2.1.1. cons</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some applications have minimum window sizes. So if I have too many
windows in one workspace, they will just overlap. Spotify and KakaoTalk
are example offenders.</p>

w-y.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I disable &#34;Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use&#34;,
in Settings → Mission Control. This has got to be one of the worst
defaults ever made.</p>

<h3 id="_code_editor"><a class="anchor" href="#_code_editor"></a>2.4. code editor</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For non-C# code, I use neovim, vim, or vi, in that order. I don’t really
care what you use. I like (neo)vim, so I use that. I just become
disappointed when people reflexively dismiss it (or Emacs) because they
have any learning curve, like at all. There’s a <em>reason</em> why vim has
one, and it’s not because Bram Moolenaar is particularly masochistic. In
particular, modal editing and buffers <a href="#buf">[1]</a> are why I enjoy
vim.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you don’t use vim, I urge you to read the manuals of the
software that you do use. Small tidbits of knowledge add up over time,
especially with common repetitive actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s also good to know a little <code>vi</code> when you mess up your FreeBSD
installation and have to dip into an emergency shell. Will <code>nano</code> be
accessible then?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Modern Vim</em> by Drew Neil is a fantastic read. I read parts of it here
and there to glean ways I can improve my vim usage. Every vim user
should read <em>Oil and vinegar - split windows and the project drawer</em>
<a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/">from
vimcasts</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see my
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree/osx/config/nvim/init.vim">neovim
configuration here</a> here, although I need to prune it a bit. The biggest
changes I’ve made are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>mapping jj to escape from insert mode, or otherwise using ctrl-[
otherwise to avoid repetitive strain from hitting escape</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf.vim</a> to fuzzy search through my
files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using <a href="https://github.com/w0rp/ale">ale</a> to asynchronously lint and fix
files (but only on file save. I hate over-eager tools that complain when
I’m halfway through writing code)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">plug</a> to manage plugins and
lazily-load them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>disabling vim’s annoying swapfile system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">gruvbox</a>, possibly one of the
best color schemes ever made. Every once in a while I experiment with a
different scheme but I inevitably get drawn back to the king. If someone
made <a href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord">Nord</a> but with green as the
main color instead of blue, I might use that.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cons_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_cons_2"></a>2.4.1. cons</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vim’s autocompletion… exists I guess. A while ago I looked into it but
it seemed not worth the hassle to set up. Anyway, ctrl-p in <code>insert</code>
mode brings up suggestions from open buffers. Good thing <code>p</code> is right
next to <code>[</code>, which takes you out of <code>insert</code> mode. /s</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aside, did you know that <code>vim</code> displays
<code>Type :quit&lt;Enter&gt; to exit Vim</code> if you hit ctrl-c, and that it’s done so
for a long time? Is your joke very outdated and unoriginal? Yes, yes it
is.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_code_editor_for_c"><a class="anchor" href="#_code_editor_for_c"></a>2.5. code editor (for C#)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">IntelliJ Rider</a> on both osx and
arch. I think the value is worth it. It’s definitely nowhere near as
snappy as vim but doing C# without autocompletions would eb… rough. The
build profiles and test runners are pretty nice. Modifying environment
variables and profile configurations is tedious.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Intellij plugin ecosystem is great- you can easily install plugins
in any of their editors, to my knowledge. There’s even an official
<a href="https://intellij-rust.github.io/">rust plugin</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, cmd-4 is the shortcut to close tabs..?! The default controls
are interesting, to put it one way.</p>

<h3 id="_tasks"><a class="anchor" href="#_tasks"></a>3.1. tasks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everything starts and ends with meetings and slack. I work on different
projects for clients and my team has a daily 5-30min call at 9am (10pm
in Korea).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Slack and our meetings we’ll discuss what needs to be done. I or
others will make bullet points of the most pertinent stuff that needs to
be done. No agile or anything,
<a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html">thank
god</a>. We previously used a few different ticket tracking systems and
I’ve found that they all suck.
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/">YouTrack</a> sucks, but it was better
than the proprietary abomination one of our clients made us use. The
only good system I’ve found is:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>make a list (or queue, if you prefer it that way) of things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>roughly ballpark estimates, with the understanding that estimating
things is notoriously difficult</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accurately prioritize those things (if everything is #1/urgent,
nothing is)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work on those things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discuss progress and blockers in daily call and/or slack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>repeat</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On top of this, issues in github/gitlab/etc are also pretty good if you
come up with good labels. Right now I’m experimenting with Github’s
Projects and semi-automated issues on our newest project.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being 13 hours ahead does pose issues occasionally, but I solved this by
going to sleep a bit later (about 1am or so). Having different things to
work on is also important– if I’m ever blocked on something, such as
waiting for a teammate to wake up and answer a question, I can just work
on something else in the meantime. This async style of work won’t work
if you always need rapid communication with your team.</p>

<p>It was glorious. Except… it was, and still is, mac only. At home I use
*nix systems or windows, so using it became tedious and I eventually

<p>As I was writing this article, I discovered
<a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nVALT</a>–Brett Terpstra’s fork.
It has more functionality like markdown support and a better interface.
No vim keybindings though, which made it unpleasant for me to use.
Terpstra is working on
<a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/10/codename-nvultra/">nvUltra</a>
currently which may fix this.</p>

<p>After I started writing this article, Alex Singh released
<a href="https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim">notational-fzf-vim</a>, which is
basically notational velocity but in vim! As the name implies, fulltext
searching is powered by <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>, which in
turn uses <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> by default.
Both are excellent tools I use daily.</p>

<p>The preview window is amazing..!</p>

<p>In order to use it, you need to specify at least one directory for the
