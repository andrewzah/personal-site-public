<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was inspired to write this after reading <em>German for
Programmers</em>. <a href="#gfp">[0]</a> It’s quite likely that I’m just biased to
see things a certain way because I work with programming languages for a
living, but I often find myself drawing comparisons among Korean and
programming.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_hangeul_basics">1. Hangeul Basics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we can get into grammar, some explanation about Hangeul–the
Korean alphabet–is needed. Korean is actually like English in that
letters are put together, so you can read any Korean once you learn
Hangeul. However, Korean letters join together in syllable blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may have seen the infamous "Learn how to read Hangeul in 10
minutes" graphic. While Hangeul is indeed very easy to learn, it does
have exceptions–quite a few actually. So maybe you can read 독립
(independence), but the actual pronunciation is different from what’s
written due to ㄹ following ㄱ. These are called 받침 <a href="#batchim">[1]</a>
rules and one just has to memorize 'em.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_grid_system">1.1. Grid System</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike Chinese or Japanese, Korean syllable blocks take the Hangeul
letters and make them into grids in a particular order.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/andrewzah.com/posts/008/hangeul.png" alt="Hangul Grid Order">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each block contains a vowel and it’s always the second character. The
block are constructed depending on whether the vowel is vertical (ㅣ ㅏ
ㅓ) or horizontal (ㅡㅜㅗ). If you want to say 'ah', ㅇ is used as a
silent character in the first slot–which makes 아: <code>ㅇ</code> + <code>ㅏ</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some vowels can also be combined: <code>ㅚ</code> is <code>ㅜ</code> + <code>ㅣ</code>, <code>ㅙ</code> is <code>ㅗ</code><br>
<code>ㅐ</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Korean fonts, all finished blocks (e.g. 쀍: ㅃㅜㅔㄹㄱ) have to be
included because it’s possible to construct them via grid rules, but a
fair amount are just gibberish. Hangeul is represented by 5 unicode
blocks in total and I recommend reading about how they get composed
together. <a href="#hunicode">[2]</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_subject_elision_especially_you">2. Subject Elision, especially -you-</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In English, we always need to specify the subject except in very casual situations. I can’t
write just "Can’t write" or "Ate an apple". In Korean however, the
subject isn’t necessary in every sentence. In fact, always including it
isn’t natural at all! Korean is highly contextual, so if you say:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>밥 먹었어요 – literally: ate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a lot of contexts, that would make most sense as (I) ate. However if
someone asks you, "Did Charlie eat?", you can still say:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(네,) 밥 먹었어요. – (yes,) ate. –&gt; "Yes, Charlie ate."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly if you ask someone else a question, it’s usually obvious if
they are the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>이 책을 읽었어요? – lit: this book read? –&gt; "Did you read this book?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It makes little sense to ask "Did I read this book?" in most
situations. (If you want to muse to yourself like "ah, did I (already)
read this book..?", that requires a specific grammar point.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re wondering, people do clarify from time to time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"밥 먹었어요? - ate?" –&gt; ""(Did you/he) eat?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"저요? / 저는요?" –&gt; "(were you referring to) Me?"</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The subject/topic still has to be included when it changes or it’s
ambiguous. If you start off by saying "저는 …" ("as for me, …"),
it’s implied the following sentences will still be about you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this sense I <em>guess</em> one could say Korean leans toward being duck-ly
typed–but that’s a tenuous comparison. Anyway, it’s different from
English where the subject almost always must be specified (strongly
typed…?), except in some spoken slang. Even very informal slang like
"d’ya eat?" still includes the subject. We’re playing a bit fast and
loose here with the comparisons.</p>

<td class="content">
Using the direct words for "you" (너, 네가, 당신)
is also quite rude unless you are close with someone. Papago and google
translate often translate "you" to 너 or 네가. Don’t use these until
you know what you’re doing. 당신 has different nuances and should also
be avoided. It’s really hard for English speakers to let go of "you",
but you must.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sentence_order">3.1. Sentence Order</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>English is an SVO (Subject Verb Object) language. "Billy ate an
apple". Korean is an SOV language. "Billy apple ate". This reversal
makes thinking in Korean actually quite difficult once one gets to
causation and more difficult sentences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>English: I went to the park because it was sunny out today. Korean: It
was sunny out today so I went to the park.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>English: I was so tired I could barely walk. Korean: To the extent that
I could barely walk I was so tired.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the perspective of a native English speaker, I find this reversal
utterly fascinating. With English the last bit of the sentence usually
has the important bit:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Do you know where the <span class="hl hl-word hl-red">
  bathroom
</span>
 is?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You basically have to finish the whole sentence there before the other
person can understand what you intend. Now with Korean:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>혹시 <span class="hl hl-word hl-red">
  화장실이
</span>
 어디에 있는지 아세요?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I often can barely get the first half of this out before I start getting an answer.

<h3 id="_finally_a_sentence">3.2. Finally, a sentence</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We made it! Let’s start with a simple sample sentence in Korean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>저는 사과를 어제 먹었어요. ~ [As for me], I ate an apple yesterday.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="hl hl-word hl-green">

</span>

<span class="hl hl-left hl-blue">먹</span><span class="hl hl-middle hl-purple">었</span><span class="hl hl-right hl-yellow">어요</span>.</p>

<span class="hl hl-middle hl-purple">past tense modifier</span>
<span class="hl hl-right hl-yellow">politness conjugation</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s already a lot going on here. The first difference you may notice
is the markers. In English, one has to identify what the subject is. In
Korean, topics and subjects are marked with 은/는 or 이/가,
respectively. Objects get marked with 을/를. Just like the subject,
these are not always necessary and get dropped in speech and texting all
the time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_markers">3.3. Markers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Korean has a number of postpositional particles that imbue meaning, some
of which vary if the last character is a vowel or not. We can easily use
a pure function to model this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">fn topic_marker(word: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
  match word.last_character_type() {
    Vowel =&gt; "는",
    Consonant =&gt; "은"
  }
}

fn plural_marker() -&gt; &amp;str {
  "들"
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are a few other markers (with simplified definitions). The text
inside the parentheses is used if the last character is a consonant:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>~에서 &#8658; from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>~까지 &#8658; until</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>~(으)로 &#8658; several meanings. roughly-speaking it shows how/via what
method or material something is carried out, or "toward" a place if
used with "to go", etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main verb here is 닫다–to close. All Korean verbs end in 다, so the
first thing we need to do is get the stem by removing <code>다</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we need the honorific level. In the first two sentences I’m talking
about myself, so I can’t use honorifics. However when the actor is "my
parents" it’s common to use honorifics, which is <code>~(으)시</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we can add a tense, we need to determine what vowel to add, and
if it should merge or not. 닫 ends in a consonant, so merging is not
possible, but the last vowel is 아 so we append <code>아</code>. (If the verb stem
ends in a vowel, like <code>가</code>, the following vowel <code>아</code> would just get
merged into <code>가</code>)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to do past tense is <code>~ㅆ</code>, which gets merged with the previous
vowel. Other tenses can depend on the last character being a vowel or
not, like future tense (<code>~ㄹ/을</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we need to think about our relationship to the audience and
append or merge a politeness/speech level. See politeness below for more
details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can model this as a basic pipeline à la Clojure:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure">(defn conjugate-verb
  [subject verb speaker audience]
  (-&gt;&gt; verb
    (remove-stem)
    (maybe-append-honorific subject)
    (append-or-merge-vowel)
    (append-or-merge-tense)
    (append-or-merge-politeness-level speaker audience)
  )
)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are even more transformations that we can apply
depending on the grammar point and the nuance of what one is trying to
say. Fun, isn’t it? At least it’s relatively consistent unlike
English–even irregular verb rules are fairly regular.</p>

<h3 id="_adding_to_the_stack">3.5. Adding to the Stack</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In linguistics, nominalization or nominalisation is the use of a word
which is not a noun (e.g., a verb, an adjective or an adverb) as a noun,
… The term refers, for instance, to the process of producing a noun from
another part of speech by adding a derivational affix (e.g., the noun
legalization from the verb legalize).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Korean, one can nominalize entire clauses and use them in other
constructs! Korean lets you do this with the <code>~는 것</code> principle. 것
means thing, but any noun can be used in place of <code>것</code>. Based on the
tense, verb type, and whether the verb ends in a vowel, <code>는</code> has
variations like <code>~ㄴ</code>, and <code>은</code>. It can also combine with other grammar
forms, like <code>던</code>, which is <code>더~ + ~ㄴ/은</code>. Digging into these would be
beyond the scope of this post.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To give you a small example, one way to say "exit" in Korean is
literally "going out place", or "a place that one goes out".</p>

<p>Nominalizing with <code>~는 것</code> is my favorite aspect of Korean because it’s
an important grammar point that blew my mind once I learned how it
worked. It’s quite commonly used as well. In day to day usage I might
say something like <span class="hl hl-word hl-purple">

<p>These are some cool traits about Korean, or things related to this post,
that don’t necessarily have to deal with programming.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_politeness_formality">3.6.1. Politeness / Formality</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Korean language conjugates differently based on the status of
speaker and intended audience. For example, one of the simplest ways to
conjugate any verb is to add <code>~어/아/여</code> to it. This is based on the
last <em>vowel</em>, not the last character.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you may have seen 감사합니다 before ("thank you", formal
polite). This is 감사하다, merged with <code>~ㅂ니다</code> because <code>하</code> ends in a
vowel. 고마워요 is another way to say thank you(informal polite): 고맙다
+ apply <code>irregular ㅂ</code> consonant ending filter + <code>~아/어/여요</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">fn get_vowel_for_verb(verb: &amp;str, formality: Formality) -&gt; {
  // ha = 하
  if verb.stem_ends_with_ha() {
    "여"
  } else {
    match verb.last_vowel() {
      "아" =&gt; "아"
      "오" =&gt; "아"
      "어" =&gt; "어"
      "우" =&gt; "어"
      "이" =&gt; "어"
      "의" =&gt; "어"
      "위" =&gt; "어"
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Korean has seven speech levels. <a href="#levels">[3]</a> When learning Korean,
the <code>아/어/여요</code> and <code>~ㅂ/습니다</code> levels are commonly used, in that
order. Using <code>아/어/여</code> (no <code>요</code>) to anyone other than close friends
(who have agreed to use lowered speech) or young kids is rude.
Foreigners get a pass at first but it’s still impolite.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plain (sometimes known as diary) form is also used, such as in diaries
and books/novels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>English lacks this concept, as we use the same conjugation for everyone
– "the prisoner ate", "the king ate", and "a God ate". What
English does have is different registers <a href="#registers">[4]</a>, such as when
you text versus when you write an academic paper or a business email.
This includes overly polite language like "Might you be interested in
eating, sir?", but nevertheless the verb remains the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_quoting_statements">3.6.2. Quoting Statements</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quoting plain statements in Korean is very easy. All you need to do is
take the sentence, conjugate the verb into plain form, and append
<code>~고 (말)하다</code>. For verbs, <code>~ㄴ/는다</code> is the plain form. For adjectives,
it’s just <code>다</code>, or the base verb.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="hl hl-word hl-green">
  (저는)
</span>
 <span class="hl hl-word hl-blue">
  먹었어요
</span>
.
<span class="hl hl-word hl-green">
  (제가)
</span>
 <span class="hl hl-left hl-blue">먹었</span><span class="hl hl-right hl-word hl-purple">
  다고 말했다
</span>
 – I ate. I said I ate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the type of statement, different particles than 다 are
used.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>declarative &#8658; <code>다</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inquisitive &#8658; <code>냐</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>propositive (let’s …) &#8658; <code>자</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>imperative or &#8658; <code>라</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>declarative with 이다 (to be) as the verb &#8658; <code>라</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>이것을 좋아하다고? – (You said that) you like this?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since this is used so much in speech, the (말)하다 (to say) part is
often omitted. If you’re learning Korean, expect to hear this a lot from
natives because Korean pronunciation is tough.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_lack_of_romanization">3.6.3. Lack of Romanization</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why does this article lack romanization? Because romanization is bad.
English and Korean sounds do not map neatly to one another. The issue
here is that Korean learners mentally map \{some english sound} &#8658;
\{some hangeul letter} and it hurts their pronunciation skills
immensely. For example, you may see this in beginner resources:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>d = ㄷ</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Except this is wildly wrong because only ㄷ is ㄷ. It is <em>close</em> to d,
in the same sense that fresh water is <em>close</em> to salt water. Close
enough, right? If you’re learning Korean, listen to videos that teach
the sound, not the most approximte English letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also have seen people write things like anyeonghasaeyo jal jinaeyo? or
similar, and it hurts my brain and heart trying to read it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, romanization systems can change over time. 조 used to be
romanized as Cho, now it’s Jo. So when I read older books that have
romanized Korean it forces me to go and learn the older system as well.
조 isn’t Jo or Cho anyway… it’s somewhere in between.</p>
