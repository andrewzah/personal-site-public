</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you may or may not know, I love <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, the
spaced repetition flash cards app. I’ve been using it in my Korean
learning journey for almost one and a half years now and I’ve written
about it before. It’s a good app, but you can have a much better
experience by making some modifications to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don’t know what Anki is or why it’s compelling, I recommend you
read <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html"><em>Augmenting Long-term
Memory</em></a>, a blog post by Michael Nielsen.
<a href="https://senrigan.io/blog/everything-i-know-strategies-tips-and-tricks-for-spaced-repetition-anki/"><em>Everything
I know: Tips and Tricks for Anki</em></a> by Jeff Shek also has a beginner’s
guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re new to Anki, the very first thing I recommend doing is
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html">reading the manual</a>, or at
least <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#the-basics">the basics</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I recommend using Anki for at least 2-3 weeks before reading the rest of
this article.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_changing_default_settings">Changing default settings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anki out of the box has two problematic defaults, and one default that I
don’t recommend personally.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_resetting_card_progress">Resetting card progress</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s say you have learned a card, but when you review it you make a
mistake in recalling it, for whatever reason. Call it a brain fart, or
pressing too quickly, etc. Or you simply forgot!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, Anki resets your progress to that of a new card. So even if
you had worked the card up to a ~4 month interval, now you have to see
it in 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, all over again…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you forget a card, you still had learned it at one point. Which
means re-learning it is now significantly easier. By completely
resetting the card’s intervals, Anki is wasting your time. It slowly
conditions you to be unwilling to press <code>Again</code>, which is not desireable
at all.\{\{fn(n=0)}}</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: In your deck’s options group under Lapses, change
<code>New interval</code> to <code>70%</code>. This means if you forget a card, the new
interval will be 70% of the old one. As for why I chose 70%, it just
felt like an appropriate amount–feel free to play with different
percentages to see what works best for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_taking_too_long_to_mark_leeches">Taking too long to mark Leeches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you initially learn a card (the card reached a 1 day interval in
default anki), if you forget it 8 times, Anki marks it as a Leech and
suspends the card, not showing it to you anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A card being a leech generally means its too complicated, or you’re
getting it confused with a similar one. 8 times means it’s going to take
way too long to identify cards that are problematic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: In your deck’s options group under Lapses, change
<code>Leech threshold</code> to <code>4</code>. You may also want to change <code>Leech action</code> to
<code>tag only</code>. This way you can easily sort for leech cards and modify or
delete them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for handling leech cards, you generally want to simplify the card, or
delete it outright. With the time and energy that you wasted on trying
to recall a leech you could have learned a bunch of other cards. If it’s
a word that you don’t want to delete, you can suspend the card, and
practice using that word outside of anki. When you feel more comfortable
with it you can unsuspend it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mixing_new_and_review_cards">Mixing new and review cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, Anki mixes new and review cards. However, reviewing is
vastly more important than learning new cards–it’s okay if you don’t
memorize new cards every day, but missing reviews really hurts your
memorization progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By putting reviews first, you can always do reviews daily and then
choose to learn new words or not depending on how busy you are, how
tired you are, etc. If the cards are mixed you can’t do this, making it
likely you’ll just skip Anki for that day entirely, which can can
quickly snowball into not using anki at all anymore. This happened to
me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: In Anki’s preferences, change <code>Mix new cards and reviews</code> to
<code>Show new cards after reviews</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_making_better_card_templates">Making better card templates</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Basic</strong> card template in Anki has two fields: <code>Front</code> and <code>Back</code>.
This is the minimum for flashcards obviously, but as you make cards it’s
likely you’ll want to have separate information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over time my personal <strong>Zah Korean</strong> card template has grown to eight
fields: <code>english</code>, <code>korean</code>, <code>grammarType</code>, <code>samples</code>, <code>hanja</code>, <code>notes</code>,
<code>image</code> and <code>sound</code>. On the front I show <code>english</code>, and <code>grammarType</code> as
a hint. Some people put sample sentences but I find this leads to
short-circuiting your recall; instead of recalling the word you
recognize that sentence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also have a <strong>Zah Colorcard</strong> template which has a <code>hexColor</code> field.
Because I initially tried to learn colors in Korean like regular
vocabulary, which makes no sense. Anki lets you pull in values easily in
the template’s html and css sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can modify a card’s fields by going to Add or Edit, then clicking on
<code>Fields&#8230;&#8203;</code>. You can add a new card type by going to Add or Edit, then
click on the type, and then click <code>Manage</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_better_styling_with_html_and_css">Better styling with html and css</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Default anki’s styling is very plain. I recommend modifying it to show
different fields in different colors. For example, my <code>grammarType</code>
field is rendered in green while <code>hanja</code> is rendered in purple. I render
my color card’s hex value dynamically. Here’s what my cards look like;
the horizontal line denotes the front and back:</p>
</div>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/andrewzah.com/posts/017/templates.jpg" alt="How my templates look for sample cards">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can go to Browse, Add, or Edit and click on <code>Cards&#8230;&#8203;</code> to get to the
style dialogue. Some premade decks include nice styling for you, or
default to a night mode. For more in-depth info, you can visit
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#card-styling">styling in the
anki manual</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_behavior_changing_plugins_are_needed">Why behavior-changing plugins are needed</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Essentially, the way Anki treats cards is not intuitive, and actually
hampers your memorization progress. Let’s say you’re reviewing a
card–you have four options. <code>Again</code>, if you forget, and <code>Hard</code>, <code>Good</code>,
or <code>Easy</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You would assume this means "I (the user) had a hard/good/easy time
recalling this card today", right? Well, Anki actually sees it as
"this card is intrinsically more difficult; please modify it
permanently".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Huh?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see, every card in Anki has an individual <code>ease</code> percentage,
starting at 250% by default. The algorithm that calculates a new
interval goes like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>NewInterval = OldInterval × CardEase × DeckIntervalModifier

Where:
  OldInterval: 1 day is the first default value
  CardEase: 250% by default
  DeckIntervalModifier: 1.0 by default, set on a per-deck basis</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you hit <code>Again</code>, <code>Hard</code> or <code>Easy</code>, Anki modifies the ease by
<code>-20%</code>, <code>-15%</code>, or <code>+15%</code>, respectively. A card’s ease can’t go lower
than 130%. You can see now why people recommend not hitting <code>Easy</code> at
all.. it quickly snowballs.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock smol">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/andrewzah.com/posts/017/wack.jpg" alt="still of Hannibal Buress on The Eric Andre Show saying the word wack">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So you might be saying, why is seeing cards too often, aka
"overlearning", an issue? Either way, I’m seeing more difficult cards
more often.. Well, research suggests that after an initial period, the
extra time spent doesn’t actually lead to better recall.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In one study (Rohrer, Taylor, Pashler, Wixted, &amp; Cepeda, 2005), college
students learned novel vocabulary (e.g., cicatrix–scar), cycling through
a list of word–definition pairs either 5 or 10 times. <strong>The extra 5
cycles yielded a substantial benefit after 1 week, but the gain was no
longer apparent after 4 weeks</strong> … From a long-term perspective,
overlearning appears to be inefficient almost to the point of wasting
time.[0]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now take a look at what happens in Anki if you lower the ease too much:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/andrewzah.com/posts/017/ease-example.jpg" alt="Image taken from Guide to Anki Intervals and Learning Steps[1]">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So even if you know a card enough to hit <code>Good</code>, if you had hit <code>Hard</code>
3-4 times prior, the interval growth rate is permanently stunted due to
how Anki works. You would have to hit <code>Easy</code> to balance it which is
counterintuitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research also suggests that larger spacing is better in the long term.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a 9-year longitudinal investigation, 4 subjects learned and relearned
300 English-foreign language word pairs. Either 13 or 26 relearning
sessions were administered at intervals of 14, 28, or 56 days. Retention
was tested for 1, 2, 3, or 5 years after training terminated. <strong>The
longer intersession intervals slowed down acquisition slightly, but this
disadvantage during training was offset hy substantially higher
retention.</strong> Thirteen retraining sessions spaced at 56 days yielded
retention comparable to 26 sessions spaced at 14 days.[2]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our results can be summarized as follows. We find that over substantial
time periods, spacing has powerful (and typically nonmonotonic) effects
on retention, with optimal memory occurring when spacing is some modest
fraction of the final retention interval (perhaps about 10%–20%).[1]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With that out of the way, here are the plugins I use.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_utilizing_subdecks">Utilizing subdecks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you review from multiple decks daily, you can use a parent deck with
subdecks to mix reviews. This is my own personal opinion, but I think
it’s better for recall if you change contexts. This is more like recall
in real life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making subdecks in anki is really easy–just make a parent deck, and drag
decks onto it. Or you can manually rename the deck in this format:
<code>Parent Deck Name::Subdeck Name</code>. If done right, it should appear like
this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/andrewzah.com/posts/017/subdecks.png" alt="A picture of anki open displaying how the interface shows subdecks">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only issue is Anki will still do reviews one deck at a time. I tried
using the experimental V2 scheduler, but it didn’t work for me. So now
we have to turn to a plugin:
<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1460733408">HoochieMama: Randomize Rev
Queue</a>. After you install this, open Anki’s preferences, and in the
Muffins tab enable <code>Hoochie Mama! RandRevQ w/ subdeck limit</code>. <strong>Note</strong>:
back up your anki before adding behavior modification plugins like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s it! Now you can review from multiple subdecks, and new cards are
still deck by deck. If you want to mix new cards as well, there’s
<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1173108619">Hoochie Papa</a>. I personally
don’t think that is as useful.</p>
