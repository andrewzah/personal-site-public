<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some common mistakes people make when getting into flash cards
and spaced repetition for the first time. Considering that Anki is
generally used for years, correcting bad habits ends up paying large
dividends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a free app that
implements
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#active-recall-testing">active
recall</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition</a>. If you’re new to Anki, the very first thing I recommend
doing is <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html">reading the manual</a>,
or at least <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#the-basics">the
basics</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So with that said, let’s get into it!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_not_doing_anki_daily">Not doing Anki daily</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you take away only one tip from this post, let it be this one.
Nothing else here matters if you don’t consistently review cards daily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The entire point of Anki is spaced repetition. Every time you skip a
day’s reviews, the following session will become more difficult. For
non-mature words (less than 30 day intervals) it’s crucial that you
review. If you don’t review for a long time, you will soon have hundreds
of reviews stacked up, which is super demotivating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I used to do Anki before bed, but this sometimes led to me skipping it
due to work, friends, or life just taking up more time and energy than
expected. Now I consistently do anki either in the morning after I’ve
fully woken up, or around lunch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you change your study time, make sure to update your Anki
Preferences, under Basic &gt; <code>Next day starts at</code>. This tip goes hand in
hand with the next one.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_mixing_reviews_and_new_words">Mixing reviews and new words</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is Anki’s default behavior. I personally recommend against this as
sometimes you don’t have the time or energy in a day to sit down and
learn the new cards. It’s okay if you don’t learn new words, but missing
reviews is really bad.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But you can’t only do the reviews, since they’re mixed in with the new
cards! So guess what ends up happening? Both the reviews and new cards
get skipped…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By changing Anki preferences to <code>Show new cards after reviews</code>, you can
always do reviews without worry. After you wake up, while you commute,
et cetera.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_studying_too_many_new_words">Studying too many new words</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not go over 20 words/day unless you are studying at least 1-2 hours
every day. Initially it may be doable but reviews will pile up so fast
it’s scary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do 20 words a day, every day, for a year, you will learn 6,720
words. That is pretty darn good! For most, if not all, languages, 3-5k
words will let you have basic conversations.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_having_the_foreign_word_on_the_front_side">Having the foreign word on the front side</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re using Anki to learn a foreign language, you want to speak that
language with someone, right? Think about how a conversation goes as a
beginner. First, you think of the word <em>in your native language</em>, then
you think of the equivalent foreign word.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you put a foreign word on the front of your anki cards, then you’re
doing it totally backward! That just trains you to recognize a foreign
word when you see it; it doesn’t train you to remember a foreign word
from your native word.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also make automatically make cards that go both ways if you use
the <code>Basic (and reversed card)</code> template. So adding a card with [dog,
강아지] will make another card that’s [강아지, dog]. If you only want
-some- cards to have a reverse, you can use the provided
<code>Basic (optional reversed card)</code> template. This one only makes a reverse
if you put something in the <code>Add Reverse</code> field (it can be any input, it
doesn’t show anywhere).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#reverse-cards">the manual</a>
for more information on reverse cards.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_only_using_premade_decks">Only using premade decks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re a beginner to studying a language, using a premade deck is
fine due to the sheer amount of time it takes to add words to a deck.
However the longer you study, the more you need your own personal deck.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use someone else’s deck, it’s basically a random collection of
words that you lack the context for. For your own personal deck you have
to see the word somewhere first, giving you more of a feeling for the
context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re trying to mass-memorize words (say, for a language test), I
recommend using Anki’s
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#decks">parent/subdecks
feature</a>. That way you can use a premade deck <em>and</em> your personal deck
at the same time. Spiffy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I explain subdecks a bit more in my
<a href="../better-anki-usage-guide-2019#utilizing-subdecks">Better Anki
Usage</a> post.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_not_including_sample_sentences">Not including sample sentences</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of language learning decks just have the word and its translation.
For very basic words this can be fine, but for most words you really do
need sample sentences so you can see the context as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I include 3 sample sentences in all the cards I make, as well as notes,
common word pairings, and the grammar type.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_having_too_many_concepts_per_card">Having too many concepts per card</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good anki card should have one concept. Avoid memorizing lists if you
really have to. If you do have to memorize a list, turn it into an
enumeration (1. 2. 3…). If you have multiple concepts, make multiple
cards.\{\{cite(n=0)}}</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When memorizing foreign words it’s really tempting to put every
definition into one card. Don’t do this. Putting related definitions
together is fine, but if a word has multiple different meanings, it
needs different cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I see this a lot in premade decks, with 1 card having 4 or 5 totally
unrelated usages of a word–and no sentence samples either, of course.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_pressing_easy_too_easily">Pressing `easy' too easily</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s can be tempting to give a review card the `Easy' grade, quickly
giving it large intervals. Don’t do this unless you know the word quite
well (in which case, why even have the card at all?). Otherwise the
interval will increase rapidly, and you’ll have forgotten it by then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually, due to how Anki works, pressing <code>Easy</code> (or <code>Hard</code>)
<em>permanently</em> modifies that card, giving it way longer intervals than
what it should be. I go over this in detail in my
<a href="../better-anki-usage-guide-2019#why-behavior-changing-plugins-are-needed">Better
Anki Usage</a> post. Almost all long-term Anki users that I talk to do not
press <code>Easy</code> often, or ever.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_not_syncing_all_the_time">Not syncing all the time</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should always sync after every session, especially if you edit
anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Did you know <code>y</code> is the sync shortcut?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_not_memorizing_keyboard_shortcuts">Not memorizing keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, learning a few shortcuts is useful since Anki is
used so much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When reviewing a card:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>undo &#8594; ctrl/cmd-z</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spacebar &#8658; Flip the card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1,2,3,4 &#8658; The numbers follow the order of the grading buttons. So for
a review, which has <code>Again</code>, <code>Hard</code>, <code>Good</code>, <code>Easy</code>, those are 1,2,3,4
respectively. A new card has <code>Again</code>, <code>Good</code>, <code>Easy</code> by default, which
are 1, 2, 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e &#8658; edit card</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other shortcuts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>r &#8658; replay audio</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@ &#8658; suspend a card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>m &#8658; mark a card (adds a <code>marked</code> tag so you can find it easily later)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ctrl or cmd-1,2,3,4 &#8658; flag a card with red, orange, green, or blue,
respectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>- &#8658; bury a card (hide it until tomorrow)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Window/tool shortcuts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>y &#8658; sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d &#8658; go to decks overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b &#8658; browse cards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a &#8658; add card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>t &#8658; stats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>/ &#8658; custom study session</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>f &#8658; create filter deck</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overkill, you say? Well.. yeah, probably. Aside from spacebar, 1,2,3,4,
r, and y, you don’t really need to know the rest unless you like being
super duper efficient.</p>
</div>
</div>
