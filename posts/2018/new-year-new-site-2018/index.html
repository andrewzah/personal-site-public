<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve migrated my website. Again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time, I decided to implement it using
<a href="https://www.getgutenberg.io">Gutenberg</a>, a static website generator which
is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. I decided it was finally
time to stop saying ``I’ll learn Rust'', and just started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also revisited Docker and containerized my website, with
<a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> as the HTTP/2 server. After using Caddy,
I simply don’t want to go back to Apache2 or Nginx for personal projects
ever again. Caddy’s configs are minimal and it automatically handles
HTTPS certificates using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s what my Caddyfile for <code>andrewzah.com</code>, <code>andrei.blue</code>, and
<code>znc.andrewzah.com</code> looks like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-caddyfile" data-lang="caddyfile">andrewzah.com, andrei.blue {
  tls your@email.com

  log / stdout {combined}
  errors stderr

  proxy / http://web:1111
}

znc.andrewzah.com {
  tls your@email.com

  log / stdout {combined}
  errors stderr

  proxy / http://znc:6697
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s it. Then with Docker, I can use a Caddy proxy per service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Gutenberg is a static website generator I have no need for a
database. Indeed, I thought it was overkill to run an application and a
Postgres instance just for a handful of posts. I much prefer storing my
posts <a href="https://github.com/azah/personal-blog">through git</a>. The
application’s footprint is overall much smaller and I have less
dependencies to manage. I want to focus on other programming projects,
not so much my website.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_2017_in_review">2017 in Review</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2017 was an exploratory year for me. I looked at Docker a lot more,
learned a bit of Clojure, and delved into Rust.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_docker">Docker</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can’t really say much other than Docker is simply amazing. After I
nuked my first VPS setup, I realized how tedious and truly
time-consuming manually setting up a server is. It’s ridiculous. Now it
takes me about 20-25 minutes to set up a server, and that’s only because
I still do a bit manually (like a docker user, ssh keys, etc). In 2018 I
plan on studying better provisioning and setup techniques so I can
automate it completely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/azah/personal-blog">docker setup</a> utilizes a script
to manage several services, such as this website and my personal ZNC
server. Adding a docker service is as simple as getting a premade docker
image and making a Caddy proxy:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"># compose.yml
version: "3.3"

services:
  bitlbee_tls_proxy:
    build:
      context: ${COMPOSE_ROOT}/services/bitlbee/
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-caddy-net
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ${COMPOSE_ROOT}/services/bitlbee/Caddyfile
        target: /etc/Caddyfile
      - type: bind
        source: ${COMPOSE_ROOT}/data/caddy/caddypath-bitlbee/
        target: /var/caddy/
    environment:
      CADDYPATH: "/var/caddy"
    ports:
      - "6667:6667"
    restart: always
  bitlbee:
    build:
      context: ${COMPOSE_ROOT}/services/bitlbee
dockerfile: Dockerfile-bitlbee</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">proxy :6667 bitlbee:6667 {
  host znc.andrewzah.com
  tls your@email.com
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So that uses my bitlbee Dockerfile and creates a Caddy proxy in the
docker container. You can see all of my services
<a href="https://github.com/azah/andrewzah.com/tree/master/services">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_clojure">Clojure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Studying Clojure — and forcing myself to stick with it — truly changed
me as a programmer. Shifting from a pure Object Oriented mindset towards
Functional Programming is easier said than done, but I cannot state how
important it is to at least understand FP. <code>Map</code>, <code>Reduce</code>, and <code>Filter</code>
are <em>powerful</em>. Languages like Ruby have implementations of these of
course, but it’s tough to force yourself to actually use them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Likewise with immutability. Coming from a Ruby background, having to
program with immutable variables was like learning how to program all
over again. It was tough. Yet as I reflect now, I think it’s a much
better approach — although mutable variables are still a good choice in
certain situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_reducers_transducers">Reducers &amp; Transducers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I particularly liked Clojure’s
<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/reducers">reducers</a> &amp;
<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers">transducers</a>. Again, it took
time to understand, but once I did… it felt absolutely amazing to
transform incoming data streams via concise, logical functions. Speaking
of functions, it was quite a lot of fun to learn about the various
functions Clojure provides, such as
<a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/zipmap">zipmap</a> and
<a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/trampoline">trampoline</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I really like Clojure. Studying the standard library’s functions felt
rewarding. The only thing I didn’t like was its debugging / compiler
output. It was not particularly great, coming from a statically typed
language like <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>. I’m still quite new to
Clojure, but I think it made some things much more frustrating than it
needed to be.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_rust">Rust</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ah, Rust, what seems like the most talked about language recently. I’ve
only been studying a bit since December, but I adore it so far. From
everything that I’ve seen, it looks like Rust takes great concepts from
various programming styles and paradigms and implements them well. Since
Rust is new(er) it can take advantage of concepts like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">concurrent
programming</a>, as well as fix or address past issues in other languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I will say is that Rust’s compiler is <em>phenomenal</em>. It makes error
hunting so easy, it’s almost like a joy. <a href="https://crates.io/">Crates.io</a>
is also fantastic. Shoutouts to those developers.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ownership">Ownership</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I love so far about rust is its model on
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">Ownership</a>.
I still don’t know all that much about Rust, but it’s been a lot of fun
reading the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">Rust Book</a>
and O’Reilly’s
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do">Programming Rust</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My goal in 2018 is to deeply study Rust and explore safe systems
programming. Possibly with audio hardware? We’ll just have to see.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_non_programming">Non-programming</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also spent almost 7 months in Korea. More info on that will come, but
I truly enjoyed my time there, and I’m making a plan on returning
full-time as a programmer.</p>
