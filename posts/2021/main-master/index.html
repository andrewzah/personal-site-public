    <div class="paragraph">
<p>2020 was a hell of a year. One of the many things that occurred is programmers
began to re-evaluate certain terminology, starting with <code>master/slave</code>. It always did puzzle
me as to why both computer science and electrical engineering had <code>master/slave</code> as terms.
I hadn’t seen that much in computing but I saw it a lot in audio engineering, particularly
when dealing with syncing clocks to a master clock. …​Whoever chose the term <code>slave</code> was
incredibly tone deaf at best, to put it lightly, especially when paired with <code>master</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I completely agree with changing these- who wouldn’t? <code>slave</code> has just nasty connotations
across history, across continents. <code>master/node</code>, <code>leader/follower</code> etc, get across the
same meaning just as well so there are no excuses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where I begin scratching my head is some of the other terms that got targeted, such as
<code>whitelist</code> and <code>blacklist</code>. These terms&#39; origins are not related to race. I actually never
knew those origins until this debacle, but they’re
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/866ynp/what_are_the_origins_of_the_words_blacklist_and/">fairly interesting</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My issue here is that people who are supposedly targeting racism are conflating the
words <code>white</code> with <code>good</code> and <code>black</code> with <code>bad</code>. I certainly do not see it this way, and I
would venture that no reasonable person does either. <code>White</code> and <code>Black</code> are relatively recent
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)#United_States">yet outdated</a>)
arbitary race constructs, yes, but <code>white</code> and <code>black</code> are also colors (or the lack thereof)
that physically exist in our universe. It does not make sense to say that any terms with a
<code>white/black</code> dichototomy must necessarily be racist. In fact, I believe it’s extremely
racist to suggest this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever happened to understanding words in context?
For example, the word <code>dominant</code> means very different things in musician and BDSM circles.
It is not difficult to interpret words in context.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where I really begin to take issue is with the targeting of the word <code>master</code>, by itself.
This makes no sense, as <code>master</code> has many varied usages outside of the
<code>master/slave</code> usage. Looking at
<a href="https://learnersdictionary.com/definition/master">Learner’s Dictionary</a> there are at least
<strong>11</strong> different uses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Are we (and github, et. al) going to ban Master’s degrees? Masters of crafts/hobbies?
Master bedrooms? White and black hats? This is honestly so ridiculous as to almost be
a parody.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="content">
But why do you care so much, Andrew? Don’t you
have more important things to worry about?

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Responding to this &#34;argument&#34; is like trying to respond to &#34;you’re just mad&#34; or &#34;you’re salty&#34;.
Going &#34;No I’m not&#34; just feeds it, and the point is to shut down conversation, not have a
discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, I take issue with the principle of the matter here. All of a sudden, a word
has been deemed NotGood and now you <strong>must</strong> acquiesce to the arbitary demands, or else you
get accused of being Racist.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<div class="title">Note</div>

<td class="content">
C’mon, be reasonable here. It’s a small change, so why not?
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The size of the change is irrelevant. I object to arbitrarily policing other people’s
behavior and words. I’m as much of an arbiter of the word <code>master</code> as you are; not at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bullying people into accepting a position by threatening them with labels is the opposite of
healthy debate.</p>

<td class="content">
Why are you opposed to something that potentially makes someone feel more safe?
</td>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course I’m not opposed to that, to a reasonable extent. There are times when it’s
appropriate to honor a request. There are other times when the request is not reasonable,
so the response is more like &#34;grow a thicker skin&#34; and &#34;stop conflating white with good&#34;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a difference of being reasonable or accomodating, and allowing people to walk over
you because they say they’re on the right side. Nobody thinks they’re on the wrong side!</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am not special. You are not special.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To put it bluntly, we [if you’re in the USA reading this] are getting
f—​ed in the a-- by our politicians and our police at all levels with zero recourse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are so many real issues to deal with (and not just in the USA), and I will not be
told by slacktivists changing the name of <strong>git branches</strong> that a) I’m Racist for disagreeing
with words arbitrarily being deemed NotGood and b) that they are doing anything useful for
Black Americans <strong>at all</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How many of you have called or emailed your house representatives and senators even once?
How many of you have voted in a non-presidential election? (Such as, say, a Sheriff’s
election)…​</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it makes you feel better to use alternative terminology or words, go right ahead.
If people want to ignore any and all context for words, that’s their prerogative, and not
really my problem. Furthermore, I will continue calling people who conflate
<code>white</code> with <code>good</code> and <code>black</code> with <code>bad</code> what they are: racists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t think I’m being unreasonable here, but I invite discussion (preferably through email)
if you disagree.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="content">
I say Black Americans here because these discussions almost always
center around the USA’s history, and completely gloss over i.e. slavery and prejudice in Asia.
But then we’d have to actually acknowledge things like Koreans being slaves as recently as
the 1920s and the fact that the USA is not the center of the universe…​
